üìù Tagster: Gamified Data Labeling Platform
üåü Project Overview
The Inspiration: Mata Shabri's Story
Long time ago, in the forests of ancient India, there lived a wise woman named Mata Shabri. Her dedication to serving Lord Rama was unmatched, and her efforts in gathering the best, most delectable fruits to present to Him became legendary. She would carefully choose the ripest, sweetest fruits, ensuring that only the finest offerings were given. This story of devotion and attention to detail has inspired Tagster ‚Äì a platform that brings modern-day "Shabris" to the world of AI development, ensuring the highest quality datasets for machine learning models.
Tagster transforms AI data labeling into a fun, rewarding experience. Our mobile app uses a TikTok-like swipe interface where users label images and videos while earning cryptocurrency rewards on Polkadot.
The Problem We Solve
As AI and machine learning systems evolve, they need vast amounts of high-quality, reliable data to improve their models. However:

AI companies struggle to gather vast amounts of data that are both consistent and high-quality
Traditional methods of gathering labeled data are slow, labor-intensive, and prone to errors
The people doing labeling work are rarely fairly compensated

By building on Polkadot, we create a transparent, fair marketplace where labelers earn direct rewards while helping advance AI development, much like how Mata Shabri carefully selected the best fruits for Lord Rama.
üîç Project Details
Technology Stack

Frontend: React Native mobile application with Polkadot.js integration
Backend: Node.js API services with substrate-compatible endpoints
Blockchain: Polkadot Plaza/Hub integration

Smart contracts for transparent reward distribution
NFT certificates that prove contribution quality
On-chain reputation system tracking labeler accuracy



Core Components

Swipe Interface: TikTok-inspired UI for quick, intuitive labeling with engaging animations
Content Feed Algorithm: Personalized content delivery based on user preferences and labeling history
Verification System: Multi-user consensus mechanism ensuring data quality
Reward Mechanism: DOT-based payments with bonus multipliers for consistency and accuracy
Gamification Elements: Leaderboards, achievements, and progression system with visual rewards

User Experience Flow

User onboards with easy wallet creation/connection
Completes simple tutorial explaining the labeling process
Begins swiping through content (images/videos)
Earns DOT rewards displayed in real-time
Unlocks achievements and rises through leaderboards
Can withdraw rewards to external wallets

Mockups

Not in Scope

We will not build our own AI models
We will not handle the training of AI with the labeled data
Initial version will support image and video labeling only (not text or audio)
No zero-knowledge proof implementation in this version

üß© Ecosystem Fit
Where Tagster Fits in Polkadot
Tagster creates a new DeFi use case by establishing a marketplace for AI data labor, directly connecting data providers with laborers through Polkadot's blockchain infrastructure.
Target Audience

Users: Mobile users looking for legitimate ways to earn crypto
AI Companies: Organizations needing large volumes of labeled data
Researchers: Academic institutions building AI models

Needs Addressed

Provides fair compensation for data labeling work
Creates transparent verification of data quality
Establishes ownership records through NFTs
Gamifies a traditionally tedious process

Similar Projects
While data labeling platforms exist (Scale AI, Amazon Mechanical Turk), none combine the gamified mobile experience with blockchain rewards and verification. On Polkadot specifically, there are no comparable projects addressing this market.

üìä Development Status
We have completed the initial design phase and user flow mockups. We've also conducted market research with potential users and AI companies to validate our concept.
Early prototypes of the swipe interface have been tested with users, with positive feedback on the intuitive design.

üîÆ Future Plans
After completing the Fast-Grant, we plan to:

Seek Additional Funding: Apply for larger ecosystem grants and approach VCs specializing in Web3
Expand Data Types: Add support for text, audio, and specialized data formats
Build AI Tools: Create tools that help companies prepare their data for labeling
Scale User Base: Launch marketing campaigns to attract both labelers and companies

Our long-term vision is to make Tagster the standard platform for decentralized data labeling, creating a sustainable economy where individuals are fairly compensated for their contributions to AI development.
‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Information
Vision Beyond Traditional Social Media
Our ambition for Tagster extends beyond just a data labeling platform. We aim to create an alternative to Instagram and TikTok shorts where users can be rewarded for their engagement rather than just having their attention monetized by advertisers. By bringing this to Polkadot, we're creating a true Web3 social experience with real utility.
Proven Track Record

Our GraduateNow project won the OpenCampus AI Web3 Application with zkVerify award
Harshal's experience creating viral applications like AngryPets.io demonstrates ability to build engaging products
Our founder has consistently delivered award-winning projects in Web3 hackathons (45+ wins)

Tagster aligns perfectly with Polkadot's vision of a connected, decentralized web by creating a fair marketplace that properly values human contributions to AI development. Unlike our previous zkVerify implementation, this version will focus on Polkadot's native capabilities to create a streamlined, user-friendly experience that can reach mainstream adoption
